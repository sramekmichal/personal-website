      <description>Authentication security on the GitHub platform is a key aspect of protecting corporate data and securing user accounts. Usually, we rely not only on standard methodologies (passwords, 2FA) but also on the significant benefits of centralized access control and easy integration with an external identity service. In this way, we could contribute to an overall increase in the level of security. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains, often used for Single Sign-On (SSO) across web applications.</description>
